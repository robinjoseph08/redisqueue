/*
Package redisqueue provides a producer and consumer of a queue that uses Redis
streams (https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro).

Features

The features of this package include:

    - A `Producer` struct to make enqueuing messages easy.
    - A `Consumer` struct to make processing messages concurrenly.
    - Claiming and acknowledging messages if there's no error, so that if a consumer
      dies while processing, the message it was working on isn't lost. This
      guarantees at least once delivery.
    - A "visibility timeout" so that if a message isn't processed in a designated
      time frame, it will be be processed by another consumer.
    - A max length on the stream so that it doesn't store the messages indefinitely
      and run out of memory.
    - Graceful handling of Unix signals (`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`) to let in-flight
      messages complete.
    - A channel that will surface any errors so you can handle them centrally.
    - Graceful handling of panics to avoid crashing the whole process.
    - A concurrency setting to control how many goroutines are spawned to process
      messages.
    - A batch size setting to limit the total messages in flight.
    - Support for multiple streams.

Example

Here's an example of a producer that inserts 1000 messages into a queue:

    package main

    import (
    	"fmt"

    	"github.com/robinjoseph08/redisqueue/v2"
    )

    func main() {
    	p, err := redisqueue.NewProducerWithOptions(&redisqueue.ProducerOptions{
    		StreamMaxLength:      10000,
    		ApproximateMaxLength: true,
    	})
    	if err != nil {
    		panic(err)
    	}

    	for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    		err := p.Enqueue(&redisqueue.Message{
    			Stream: "redisqueue:test",
    			Values: map[string]interface{}{
    				"index": i,
    			},
    		})
    		if err != nil {
    			panic(err)
    		}

    		if i%100 == 0 {
    			fmt.Printf("enqueued %d\n", i)
    		}
    	}
    }

And here's an example of a consumer that reads the messages off of that queue:

    package main

    import (
    	"fmt"
    	"time"

    	"github.com/robinjoseph08/redisqueue/v2"
    )

    func main() {
    	c, err := redisqueue.NewConsumerWithOptions(&redisqueue.ConsumerOptions{
    		VisibilityTimeout: 60 * time.Second,
    		BlockingTimeout:   5 * time.Second,
    		ReclaimInterval:   1 * time.Second,
    		BufferSize:        100,
    		Concurrency:       10,
    	})
    	if err != nil {
    		panic(err)
    	}

    	c.Register("redisqueue:test", process)

    	go func() {
    		for err := range c.Errors {
    			// handle errors accordingly
    			fmt.Printf("err: %+v\n", err)
    		}
    	}()

    	fmt.Println("starting")
    	c.Run()
    	fmt.Println("stopped")
    }

    func process(msg *redisqueue.Message) error {
    	fmt.Printf("processing message: %v\n", msg.Values["index"])
    	return nil
    }
